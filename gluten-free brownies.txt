Ingredients
3/4 c. grapeseed oil
3/4 c. dutch process cocoa
1 1/2 c. natural cocoa
1 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. baking powder
5 large egg whites
1 2/3 c. granulated sugar
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
1/4 c. chopped hazelnuts (optional)

Directions

    Preheat oven to 325°. Grease a 9”-x-9” baking pan with cooking spray, line with parchment, then grease with cooking spray again. 
    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together cocoas. In a small pot over medium heat, heat oil to 240°, about 2 minutes. Pour hot oil over cocoa and mix to combine fully until no dry spots remain, then let sit for 10 minutes.
  
    To cocoa bowl, add salt, baking powder, and egg whites. Using a hand mixer, beat until mixture is fully incorporated and large crumbles form. Add sugar and vanilla and continue beating until mixture becomes completely smooth, lightened, and glossy.
    Transfer batter into prepared pan and smooth top, then sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts, if using.
  
    Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.
    Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
